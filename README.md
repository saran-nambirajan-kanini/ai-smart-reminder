# PropelIQ-Copilot

## Executive Summary

PropelIQ-Copilot is an AI-powered development framework that automates software development workflows from requirements gathering to implementation. It provides structured workflows for generating specifications, user stories, tasks, and code while enforcing comprehensive development standards across multiple languages and frameworks. The system combines business analysis, architecture design, and quality assurance into a unified platform for rapid, high-quality software delivery.

## Setup

PropelIQ-Copilot requires initial configuration to integrate with your project and enable AI-powered workflow automation. This setup process configures the framework files, API credentials, and MCP server integrations necessary for full functionality.

### Prerequisites

Before beginning setup, ensure you have:
- VS Code installed on your system
- Node.js and npm (required for MCP server integrations)
- Context7 API key (obtain from [Context7](https://context7.com))

### Installation Steps

#### Step 1: Copy Framework Files

Copy the following directories and files to your project root:
- `.github/` - Contains prompt definitions and development instructions
- `.propel/` - Contains templates and project artifacts
- `.vscode/` - Contains MCP configuration
- `.env-example` - Environment variable template

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Rename `.env-example` to `.env` in your project root
2. Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder with your actual Context7 API key:

```bash
CONTEXT7_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
```

#### Step 3: Configure Source Control

Add the following entries to your project's `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive configuration:

```gitignore
# PropelIQ-Copilot Framework
.env
.github/*
.propel/templates/*
.vscode/mcp.json
```

This ensures API keys and framework-specific files remain local to your development environment.

#### Step 4: Verify Installation

1. Open "Chat" by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + I`
2. Type `\` (backslash) to view available prompts
3. Confirm that all workflows from `.github/prompts/` appear in the list

If commands are visible, your setup is complete and PropelIQ-Copilot is ready to use.
